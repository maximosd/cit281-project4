UO CIT 281 - Project 4

# Project: 
Project 4 focused on server communication using Postman. We built off of our previous project where we learned how to export and import functions. This time, we focused on making requests to our server using Postman. We also learned how to handle different types of requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. We learned how to handle unknown routes and how to return appropriate responses. Throughout this project, we implemented testing functions to ensure that we were on track for a successful project.

# Lab 5:
In Lab 5, we set up Postman on our computers. We also learned how to navigate the interface to switch between different requests. We practiced making GET and POST requests to our server. We dealt with a database of students and depending on the route, we returned unique information for that specific student.
